# Tests

The idea was to have a directory of examples which showed what kind of output a function produced and also how to use it. This is currently pretty clumsy, so it may not last long (or at least not on the public repo).

## Current Included Functions:
- `make_mask()`                 src/utils/mask.py
- `make_perimeter_polygon()`    src/utils/perimeter_polygon.py 
- 'find_neighbors()`            src/analysis/neighbors.py
