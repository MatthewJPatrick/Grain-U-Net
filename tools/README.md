+ Alignment
> This one is for aligning images with selected points. Beware its pretty slow, instructions are included at top of page.
+ Autocrop
> This is mean to crop aligned images into a set of overlapping image pairs and then there is another script that can recompile them. The idea was that we would try running the unet on a bunch of littler images an stitch them together in the end. Ultimately, this hasn't shown to improve results, actually just creating artifacts. Still handy for breaking down aligned images though.

Okay, so these are pretty jank, so maybe we'll end up taking them out of this repo. I figure that I might as well try adding them (and encourage y'all to add any helper scripts you write) to try to reduce redundant work, but we'll see. 

**Note:** Please reach out if you want be to de-obfuscate these, I didn't do a great job commenting, and it's probably not worth working it out alone (unless what its doing is super obvious to you).
