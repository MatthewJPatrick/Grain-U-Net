# Notes
I'm still deciding if it's a good idea to have data in this code base. I tend to keep code and data on different platforms so if I mess with it, and change code it won't mess with your local version. So for now, the data I'm using can be found here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DqZTwz4W53z-whbqt3C8YNUVCFEnQFn0?usp=sharing

Please let me know how you want to set up data sharing. Maybe each time we expand upon the set dramatically we should add a folder containing that data to the group drive? The benefits of this is that we could be looking at the data modularly, the downside is that the code isn't well suited for that (though thats something we could change).
